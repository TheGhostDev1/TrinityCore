After the destruction of the Drenor, the demon lord Kil''geden took Scepter Sargeras from Ner''zul. Finally, the artifact returned to the Legion, and Kil''geden intended to use it to capture Azeroth.

But Kil''geden was weaker than Sargeras. He could not open the portal with enough power even for his avatar. Then he conspired with Kel''tas Solar Wanderer to create a gate through the Solar Well, a dead source of elven blood power. Relying on the power of the scepter that breaks through the worlds, Kel''thas''s portal could pass through Kil''geden in his true form.

Somehow Ner''zhul waited for the right moment and rushed to embody his plan - selflessly and without thinking about the consequences.

After Horde''s defeat in the Second War, Ner''zul wanted to boost the morale of his comrades-in-arms. For this he decided to open portals to new worlds that can be conquered.

He could have influenced the Guardian in many ways, but he never managed to get her to remove the Scepter from the underwater grave.

His avatar was only a pale shadow of the true image of dark titanium, but it did not matter. He knew that even if he did not defeat Egwin, he could still use it to his advantage. All he had to do was to weaken its defenses, punch a small hole so that a particle of his spirit could penetrate inside.

The scepter of Sargheras was a miracle of magic and the spell of Badgers. Truly, it was an instrument worthy of titanium. It could cut through the binding matter of the physical universe, opening portals to any world of interest to Sargheras. However, these cuts were small, and only part of the soul of dark titanium could pass through them. But this misfortune was small. Sargeras only had to become more ingenious in his plans. He was waiting.
<BR/><BR/>
And finally, after thousands of years, he had an opportunity. Guardian Egwin became the most powerful sorceress in Azeroth. Even the Tirisphalus Council could not find any control over her. Her pride made her an ideal target for Sargheras. He could not penetrate Azeroth in his most formidable guise, but he could try to make a rebellious keeper an instrument of his machinations.

Many have heard of the shining gem that crowns Sargheras'' sceptre. It is believed to symbolize the evil eye of Sargheras, that it was only a glimpse of Azeroth before the dark titanium was plunged back into the Circle of the Void. But this version is far from being true. 
<BR/><BR/>
Shortly after the War of the Ancients, Sargeras had a vision: The Source of Eternity collapsed again, but this time it drew Sargeras to the very core of Azeroth. Sargheras was there only for a brief moment, but he saw the sleeping soul of Azeroth. And the soul suddenly opened one eye and looked directly at the dark titanium. Sargeras was fascinated.

Thousands of years ago Sargeras ordered the most talented Eredar sorcerers to make a space ram for him. They carried out his order.

First, they performed dark rituals to collect countless portals in one wand. Then projected a reinforced artifact in all corners of the Great beyond darkness, weaving it into the fabric of reality as a thread for which you can pull and open the seams of the physical universe. For this colossal deed, a hundred dragon-dwellers sacrificed a hundred demons, choosing them from those troops that participated in the failed Azeroth campaign.

After his defeat at the Source of Eternity, Sargheras immediately devised another way to get to Azerot. He realized that there was no hope for a static portal - it would take an enormous amount of energy to pass titanium through. After the destruction of the Source of Eternity, there was nowhere to get that much energy in Azeroth. In addition, the long work that had to be done by the highborn gave the intentions of Sargheras, and the forces of resistance managed to prevent him. No, to overcome Azeroth''s defense, Sargheras had to invade the world suddenly.

For weeks, the highborn labored without rest, creating and weaving spells to make a portal in the Source of Eternity, the source of power of the night elves.

But when Sargheras was already ready to step into Azeroth, the forces of resistance of the night elves intervened. The rebels broke the spells and destroyed the Source of Eternity. Sargeras was thrown back into the Circle of the Void, once again losing the chance to capture Azeroth. The Dark Titan swore vengeance.

Becoming one of the generals of the Blazing Legion, Archimond found the use of Tal''kiel skull. During his lifetime, the Tal''kiel had no equal in the art of controlling demons. The skull retained these skills. Weaving words in spells, Archimond guided them through the skull, forcing hordes of demons to obey themselves. Following his orders, they destroyed enemies with deadly grace, as if dancing.

Since then, the skull has been in the hands of several close generals Sargeras. Preference was given to those who led the attack on the worlds most attractive to the dark titanium. The last of them was the horror lord Mephistrot, commander of the Legion''s invasion of Azeroth.

"Phrenology - the science of the skull structure and the relationship of its shape to intelligence - was spread on Argus during the second duumvirate. Its adherents believed that willpower, memory, sensitivity and other characteristics of the Ã©ridar are reflected in his skull, and the shape and convexity of the skull bones can be judged by the intellect and inclinations of its owner. There were even hypotheses that the skull of the eredar, especially susceptible to magic, can be used to control magical energy even after his death. Certainly, such practice was too barbaric to receive a wide circulation, however separate cases met.

The news of Tal''kiel''s treachery stunned Velen and Kil''jeden. He called upon entire legions of the creatures of Badgers to kill the legitimate rulers of the Eredars and create their own empire. He turned to a terrible new force, whose limits and possibilities were unknown. He should have been stopped - quickly and mercilessly. To prove his loyalty to the rulers, Archimond removed the defenses that hid Tal''kiel''s army, and led an army of magicians to the place where the Awakens secretly trained their demons.

For many centuries, the necrolite Satayel has been saving Ulthalesh and the source of power they created. When Sargheras learned of her deception, he became furious.

The final assault on Icecrown Citadel now ranks among the most legendary military campaigns in recent memory.

Marching alongside some of the greatest champions of Azeroth, Tirion Fordring continued his crusade against the Scourge, staging an all-out attack on the Lich King''s seat of power.

In the aftermath of the Second Battle for Light''s Hope, the Ashbringer remained in the possession of Tirion Fordring, highlord of the Argent Crusade. In order to draw out the greatest champions of Azeroth, Tirion instituted a contest of strength and battle prowess known as the Argent Tournament.

In time, Tirion''s Argent Crusade successfully breached the main gate of the Lich King''s stronghold of Icecrown Citadel.

He faced off against his onetime ally, a former Knight of the Silver Hand, Tirion Fordring. Ultimately Darion was subdued even as the dreaded Lich King himself, Arthas, appeared on the battlefield.

In an apparent act of contrition, Darion threw the Ashbringer to Tirion, who purified it with his touch. Tirion then focused his full efforts on the Lich King, who was forced to retreat after a single mighty blow from the uncorrupted Ashbringer.

Yrgrim led the earthen survivors to Keeper Tyr, the one being he believed could save them from the Winterskorn. The vrykul warrior did not expect a reward for doing so. Quite the opposite. Yrgrim had murdered scores of innocent earthen, and he thought Tyr would execute him for his transgressions.

According to one vrykul legend, these are the words Tyr spoke to Yrgrim: "I cannot wash the blood from your hands. No one can. All I can offer you is a way forward. Stand by my side. Hunt the wicked with the same ferocity you once used to hunt the earthen. Do this and you will find the path to redemption."

"At some point in Azeroth''s distant past, humanity emerged in Tirisfal Glades. The iron-skinned vrykul who lived there slowly died off. Many of them suffered from the curse of flesh, a strange malady that transformed them into creatures of flesh and blood.
<BR/><BR/>
"Yet one group of vrykul lasted longer than the others. They formed a secretive group-Tyr''s Guard-to protect Keeper Tyr''s tomb. The vrykul of this order knew that they would not live forever, and so they inducted some of the fledgling humans into their ranks.

"The vrykul taught the human members of Tyr''s Guard the history of the fallen keeper, his tenets of self-sacrifice and justice, and the truth of what lay within the tomb."

Tyr''s followers then enchanted the tomb with protective wards. They bound the Silver Hand to these magical seals, thereby preventing anyone from touching it in the future.

Long before the War of the ancient Taurian tribes roamed through the forests of ancient Kalimdor. The tribes of Krutigorje then headed the leader Moren Krutigorje, who saved from an attack of fire elements On''aru, the Wild God in the form of a huge eagle. In gratitude for her salvation, the eagle put a part of her essence into the spear of Morin, endowing it with powerful magical properties. Moren carved the On''ara name on the shaft of the spear, and since then it has been called the Spear of the Great Eagle in her honor. 
<BR/><BR/>
In memory of the heroes with whom he was brought together by fate, the mighty defeated opponents and the grandiose events to which he had witnessed, Morin carved the Great Eagle and their names on the Spear. This tradition was continued by his followers, who owned the spear after him. So gradually, the spear became the living history of the Krutigorje tribe.

This spear, made before the War of the Ancients, has a unique curved tip in the shape of an eagle''s beak, and the energy of the Wild Gods, the mighty Ancient Animals, makes it incredibly powerful and unique in its kind. The Claw of Prey has repeatedly helped the Taurions of Azeroth to defend their homeland in clashes with many invaders. The Spear was passed from generation to generation to the best hunter of the Krutigorie tribes until it was lost. The Taurians would have great respect for the owner of their legendary weapons, but the demons of the Legion would also tirelessly pursue him.

Akaari was a valuable acquisition for Sargheras because of his absolute devotion. She no longer had her will, but the cunning remained with her.

Akaari lurked among Sargheras''s army fighters, eradicating discontent and eliminating too ambitious demons who hoped to seize power.

The Lord of the Demons agreed that the Council of Shadows needed a silent and inconspicuous killer. He gave Gul''dan detailed instructions... and all the materials to create two deadly blades that had no equal on the Drenor.

Immediately after the foundation of the Horde, Gul''Dan took Garona under his patronage. She was an outcast, a semicircle: in her veins flowed blood orcs and drains, and from birth she had to fight for her life. She quickly learned to avoid unnecessary fights and silently kill persistent pursuers. 
<BR/><BR/>
Submitting it to his will, Gul''dan secretly began teaching Garon the craft of murder. She did not understand why he was doing it, and hated him for his cruelty. But she obeyed him. The half-hearted woman was used to doing everything to survive.
<BR/><BR/>
Soon Garona proved her skill in handling all kinds of weapons, but Gul''dan wanted more. His position in the Horde was shaky - if anyone knew that the Council of Shadows killed Gul''dan''s rivals, he would have been bad. 
<BR/><BR/>
Gul''dan was looking for a weapon that would allow Garona to kill without leaving a trace.

These daggers were created in order to kill the heroes and shed innocent blood, and in the hands of Garona Polutorchikha they were drunk with her breath. 
<BR/><BR/>
Suffering and Sadness have justified their name. They killed kings, commanders, soldiers, magicians and demons - there were no numbers of victims. Thanks to these weapons, the First Horde almost conquered Azeroth. 
<BR/><BR/>
The bloody path of these daggers began on the Drenor, soon after the Blazing Legion enslaved the Orc clans.

Adolescents prepare for their trials with years of training, communion with the spirits, and by tattooing sigils of power onto their skin. A common rite is to travel to one of the violent, beast-ruled islands near the capital to steal or subdue a wild creature. $b$BThe lesser troll races have their own, humbler versions of this tradition. But the mastery of ravasaurs or raptors is nothing compared to the power required to call upon a devilsaur or direhorn.',0,0,0,17688)
,(4600,'"No. I will not do this... But my sister will not mind!" - answered blonde and laughed. The dark-haired elf led with her eyebrow, nodded and shook her shoulders. She made a barely visible gesture with her hand, and her body was filled with heat. Her clothes, which were already too frank, immediately burned. When Mark hugged her, she barely heard any words. A symbol appeared above Mark''s head, surrounded by his radiance, but invisible to him.
"How... I feel good. What was that?" - he asked.

"Persistence, my lord. You''ll need it." Only then he noticed that the elf''s feet do not touch the floor and he does not feel its weight. Mark''s head became dizzy, countless options were spinning in his head, and his strong hands...

,(4599,'In the upstairs room, Mark saw two girls so beautiful that he barely managed to stay on his feet. One of them had long blonde hair that looked right into the Sunwell when looking at it. The other had hair short and black as night. Waking up from his numbness, Mark realized that there were enemies in front of him! He drew the sword from its scabbard, which brightened the faces of the blood elves.

The elf with shining hair spoke first. "Look. Always ready to fight." She touched her finger to the tip of the sword and pulled the blade away from her, stepping closer and not taking her eyes off his eyes. "Do you believe in love at first sight? Or do I need to show myself to you a second time?"

Mark clung to her, pressing the blade of the sword to her body, whispered something in her ear and pulled away, waiting for a reaction to his words.',4600,0,0,17930)
,(4598,'"Mark, maybe you could agree to... special offer? I''m afraid I can''t fulfill your usual order today." Mark did not escape the attention that she emphasized the word "usual" and said it not without disappointment in her voice. Their eyes met again, and she squeezed his hand firmly before she let go.

"If you insist, may I at least appreciate what you have to offer me? - he said.

"I have excellent armor, a cute companion and even a rare riding animal at my disposal," said Madame Goya. In her voice again appeared the usual playfulness. She kept silent for a short while and held her chin with her paw, depicting thoughtfulness. "But the most valuable thing I have is hidden upstairs."

Mark raised his eyebrows, expressing interest. "Then I''ll see you upstairs," he voiced his decision. Her eyelashes shook, and Mark headed for the stairs leading to the second floor of this strange tavern.',4599,0,0,17930)
,(4597,'Contrary to custom, the "In the Mists" tavern was extremely popular among the locals that day, and Mark had to make his way through the crowd to a secluded spot in a dark corner of the hall. "Mark, how glad I am to see you again", - he heard an insinuating, almost purring voice.

Mark smiled and narrowed his eyes so that his eyes quickly got used to the semi-darkness. "Madame Goya, what an honor!" - He replied.

Madame Goya did a knixen, and Mark was thrown into a fever. He immediately remembered why pandariek are called donuts. He bowed to her and gallantly took her paw. Kissing her smooth fur, he kept his eyes on the scarred guard standing behind Madame Goya.',4598,0,0,17930)
,(4596,'Mark''s warhorse galloped towards the building. Seeing him, one of the guards, whom nature did not deprive of magnificent forms, barely noticeably blushed. Mark dismounted and gave the reins to the stablemaster who had arrived. Then he spoke with a hand on her shoulder. "Kama, have you considered my proposal?" He asked with mock seriousness.

Kama rolled her eyes. The black fur around her eyes accentuated her face. "I donâ€™t think the love of my life is going to like it."

Mark burst out laughing and headed for the exit. "Nevertheless, I would be glad to get to know her better somehow!" - he said, leaving.',4597,0,0,17930)
